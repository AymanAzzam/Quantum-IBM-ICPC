# Quantum-IBM-ICPC
Solutions for Quantum IBM ICPC Contest 2021.

### Libraries
The common library for Qunatum Computers is (qiskit)[https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html] 

### Problems
Each problem is explained in its file. All problems are realted to (Hamming weight)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight]. The first problem partitioned to 3 parts, The second problem partitioned to 2 parts and The third problem partitioned to 5 parts.

### Solutions
I have completed only the first exercise. I made solution for the second exercie but it needs optimization in memory to pass.

### Useful Resources
1. (Document)[https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/introduction.html] explains most things about qunatum (basic gates, important algorithms)
2. (Video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2WcZS4yO1Q] explains how to convert a Unitary Matrix to a set of one & two qubit gates. before watching this video you should understand the (Grover's Algorithm) first[https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/grover.html]
3. (Elementary Gates)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9503016.pdf] Explaination without code.
